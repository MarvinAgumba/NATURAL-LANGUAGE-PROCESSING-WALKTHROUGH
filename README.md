# NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) OVERVIEW

**Natural Language Processing, or NLP**, is the study of how computers can interact with humans through the use of human language

**Stemming:** accomplishes this by removing the ends of words where the end signals some sort of derivational change to the word\
**Lemmatization** accomplishes pretty much the same thing as stemming, but does it in a more complex way, by examining the morphology of words and attempting to reduce each word to its most basic form, or lemma.
