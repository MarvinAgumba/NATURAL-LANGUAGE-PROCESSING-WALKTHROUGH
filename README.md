# NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) OVERVIEW

**Natural Language Processing, or NLP**, refers to analytics tasks that deal with natural human language, in the form of text or speech. These tasks usually involve some sort of machine learning, whether for text classification or feature generation, but NLP isn't just machine learning. Tasks such as text preprocessing and cleaning also fall under the NLP umbrella.

The most common Python library used for NLP tasks is _`Natural Language Tool Kit`_, or _`NLTK`_ for short. This library was developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and quickly became the most powerful and complete library of NLP tools available.

Some important NLP Concepts:
  - Word Vectorization
  - Regular Expressions `(Regex)`
  - Feature Engineering for Text Data
  - Context-free grammar and POS Tagging
  - Text Classification

**Stemming:** accomplishes this by removing the ends of words where the end signals some sort of derivational change to the word\
**Lemmatization** accomplishes pretty much the same thing as stemming, but does it in a more complex way, by examining the morphology of words and attempting to reduce each word to its most basic form, or lemma.

## PREPROCESSING OF OUR TEXT USING NLTK

 - **Stop Word Removal**: NLTK contains a full library of stop words, making it easy to remove the words that don't matter from our data.

- **Filtering and Cleaning**: NLTK provides simple, easy ways to create and filter frequency distributions, as well providing multiple ways to clean, stem, lemmatize, or tokenize datasets.

- **Feature Selection and Feature Engineering**: NLTK contains tools to quickly generate features such as bigrams and n-grams. It also contains major libraries such as the Penn Tree Bank to allow quick feature engineering, such as generating part-of-speech tags, or sentence polarity.
